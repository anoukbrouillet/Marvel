# Marvel SQL Project 
I used SQL to analyze various Marvel character attributes. This project demonstrates my knowledge of basic SQL queries. These queries include select, from, math operators, as, where, having, group by, order by, and case. The first queries find the maximum and minimum values for height and weight of the characters. Then I found the distribution of character's hometowns. Then I created an overall skill value by adding up the individual attribute ratings such as intelligence, strength, speed, durability, etc. After this I found the average intelligence and strength among all Marvel characters. This gave a value to compare to each Marvel character and identify if the characters have above or below average intelligence and strength. Overall, this project extracts insights from the databse.
